# Translate Subtitle


## Summary

Translate subtitle(.srt) to your native language. Generate single or dual displayed subtitle.  
Version: 1.1

Sometime struggling to understand MOOC contents even though with English subtitle.  
I always watch with English subtitle --> switch to my native language --> back to English subtitle again.  
It's bit cheat way but I think great method to understand each word relationship and boost my learning speed.  
Good for second language learner like me.

### Notice

As original authors wrote, this is just experiment using selenium web driver.  
Please use with moderation and if need many translation, it would be good to consider using Google Translate API.

### Use

- Set **target_path** and check **input_lang**, **output_lang** language notation (default: English(en) --> Japanese(ja))  
- Check option **dual_subtitle**, **make_backup_folder** (always keep original srt file)  
- Run (checked on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5)
